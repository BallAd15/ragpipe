      "Based on the document snippets provided, \"Founder mode\" can be inferred to be a unique way of running a company, characterized by the continued involvement and leadership of the original founder(s), even as the company grows. It differs from \"manager mode\" which is typically associated with traditional business management practices. Founder mode emphasizes a more personal and direct engagement of the founder with various levels of the company, and may involve unconventional methods that may not fit into traditional business norms. However, the specifics of founder mode are not yet well-defined or understood, as it's a relatively new concept and there's little formal literature about it. It's also noted that as the concept becomes more established, there's a risk of it being misused or misunderstood.\n"
